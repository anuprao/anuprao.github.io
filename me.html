            <p>My name is Anup Jayapal Rao. I live in Bangalore, India. 
<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy graphics in all forms of media, be it print or pixel.
<br/>
<br/>
I started learning graphics when I was in my 6th grade on a BBC micro. I briefly encountered Unix in my school before getting into Windows Programming.
I spent most of my early college years fiddling with Win32 and OpenGL (software rasteriser). My later years at college were all about Electronics, 3D art with Blender and Linux !
Soon, I was absorbed into the Open Source way of working and would attempt to use it every day. However, my work would often drive me to develop on Windows. 
This helped in a few ways, I learnt to appreciate the pace at which Open Source Software was progressing. It soon earned my bread and butter.
<br/>
<br/>
Due to the undue attention I had for Blender3D, I started experimenting with Python. It was something I was logically inclined to fall for.
The simplicity and readability helped me learn a lot of programming concepts. I even began using Python for problems at work. At home, I would feverishly dabble with hobby electronics.
Python would keep me flying, while Electronics would keep me grounded. And, while Blender would keep me dreaming, OpenGL would make me wonder about endless possibilities. All this held 
together by Linux which was my playing field.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, almost 20 Years since my first graphics program, I still feel my thirst unquenched. My passion unbridled.
